# Getting Started
---

## What do i need to start building an iOS app?

1. Apple Mac computer. A mac with decent dual/quad core processor and 16 GB ram will suffice.
2. Apple [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) as our IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
3. Understanding of [Human Interface Guidelines.](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
4. Fluency with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming language.
5. Source control system, for tracking changes to our source code. [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) in our case.
6. Apple developer account, to understand app signing process and deploy our apps for public use. 

At very minimal our aproach to app development looks like this
