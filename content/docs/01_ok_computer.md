## Building a Hello World app

A 'Hello World' program is a very effective way to learn a new language or programming concept.

As a tribute to one of my favourite music band [RadioHead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead), we are going to do a ['OK Computer'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer) instead of 'Hello World'.

## Setup for Ok Computer
