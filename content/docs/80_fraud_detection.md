Behavioral Biometrics:
https://www.counterpointresearch.com/behavioral-biometrics-next-step-user-authentication/
Behavioral biometrics provides a new generation of user security solutions that identify individuals based on the unique way they interact with smart devices such as smartphones, tablets or notebooks. The technology creates a unique profile for each user by tracking various metrics that are likely unique to the individual.

Behavioral profiling is the use of machine learning and advanced analytics to analyze security data, and define profiles of typical behavior for users or computing systems. This makes it possible to identify anomalies in behavior, which may be malicious activity by attackers.

Verify and approve your good applicants, faster.
Being able to identify fraudulent behaviors and attributes connected to an email or phone number, gives you critical insights during important transactions, like loan applications. Identify and reject fraudsters immediately, while streamlining processes for your good customers.

Fraud detection and prevention solutions.
The moment any device attempts to connect to your site or app, you’ll be able to spot user behaviors and device information that leads to fraud, and stop that fraud attempt in real time.

FraudForce - Device Based Reputation

While home and property owners themselves may sometimes knowingly commit insurance fraud in the wake of a natural disaster, they can also just as easily be the victims. Natural disasters can bring thousands of con artists out of the woodwork posing as a wide range of "helpful" individuals. From relief workers that instead aim to loot whatever remains to insurance claims agents to fake contractors that make claims for work they never performed - or even intended to perform - even smaller natural disasters can cost millions of dollars just in fraudulent claims alone.

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the US attorney's office received more than 30,000 fraud complaints and they were still receiving them 9 years after the storm had passed. Not all fraud perpetrated in the wake of Hurricane Katrina was insurance fraud, either. In just the few days following the storm, two individuals were able to con more than 2,500 police officers, firefighters, sheriff's deputies, and FBI agents into disclosing personal information for the purposes of committing identity theft.

For instance, homeowners can enter the information of a proposed contractor that can be quickly vetted by the system before they ever do any work. This can help protect both homeowners and insurance companies from a wide range of fraudulent claims.
